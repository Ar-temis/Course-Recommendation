**Setup:** [SETUP.md](https://github.com/Ar-temis/Course-Recommendation/blob/main/SETUP.md) 

## What it does

As a student you have to find what courses are available, which ones go together, and which ones you need for you major. 
Finally, you have to schedule them, and if they don't match you find yourself back at square one.

So, what if there was an assistant that just gives you all the available options and you choose from there? 
That's what my AI assistant is ***exactly*** doing for you.

**This assistant can:**
- Find major requirements
- Recommend majors
- Find course prerequisites
- Schedule next semester's courses

## Quickstart
**Please go to [SETUP.md](https://github.com/Ar-temis/Course-Recommendation/blob/main/SETUP.md)** 

In the project root folder, after setting up, you can run the app using:
```bash
# For frontend app
flask run

#Just for terminal chatting without any frontend:
python3 crec/agent.py
```
