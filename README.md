# Course-Recommendation
As a student scheduling all the available courses to you can be a like finding a needle in a haystack. 
You have to find what kind of courses are available, which courses go together, and what courses do you need for you major. 
Finally, you have to schedule them, and if they don't match you often times find yourself back at square one.
So, what if there was an assistant that just gives you all the available options and you just choose from there? 
That's what my AI assistant is ***exactly*** doing for you.
